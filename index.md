# Getting Started with PARADISEC

## Sign up as a user with PARADISEC
Signing up with PARADISEC means you become a PARADISEC user. This allows you to gain access to collections in the archive. Only as a user can you access data in a PARADISEC collection after agreeing to PARADISEC’s conditions of access, or sending a request to access data that has restrictions on viewing by following instructions provided by the collector.

You also need to sign up with PARADISEC if you wish to deposit material to the archive. Go to the PARASDISEC catalog web page: [http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/](http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/), and click on **Sign up** in the upper right‐hand corner. Once you sign up, you get an automated message informing you to check your email to confirm your account, _“A message with a confirmation link has been sent to your email address. Please open the link to activate your account”._ Click on the link in your email to confirm.


## Creating a collection with PARADISEC

Only PARADISEC administrators can create a collection in the catalog.  When you are ready for us to create a collection, contact the PARADISEC administration at [admin@paradisec.org.au](admin@paradisec.org.au) or the [CoEDL Data Manager](mailto:julia.miller@anu.edu.au). You will need to provide us with the following information:

* Collection ID (see below)
* A brief title of your collection
* A more detailed description of your collection
* Funding body (if applicable) (e.g. ARC, ELDP, etc.)
* Grant identifier (if applicable) (e.g. CoEDL = CE140100041 or Wellsprings = FL130100111)

You can edit the collection information after it has been created, adding details such as the originating university, country, language(s), etc. You also can set the map, define access, and assign editor privileges at the collection level.

### Collection ID

Once you are added as a user, we can help you start a collection.  First you need to create a name for your collection; it should be unique and include your initials (all caps and no spaces) and a digit:

Example collection IDs:
**JM1, JCM4, NT6, PK1, PK2, etc.**

The digit is required and it distinguishes you from someone with the same initials (John Mansfield, Julia Miller, etc), but also allows for multiple collections, should you require, e.g. **JM1, JM2... JM85**.
