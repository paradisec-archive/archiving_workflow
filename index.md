This page is dedicated to helping you begin the seemingly overwhelming process of getting your materials organised and eventually archived. The following information is geared toward preparing your collection for [PARADISEC (Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Engangered Cultures)](https://www.paradisec.org.au/).

## STEP 1: Sign up as a user with PARADISEC
Signing up with PARADISEC means you become a PARADISEC user. As a user you can access data in an open collections after agreeing to PARADISEC’s conditions of access, or you may send a request to access data that has restrictions on viewing by following instructions provided by the collector on their catalog page.

You also need to sign up with PARADISEC if you wish to deposit material to the archive. 

The process of signing up is simple- go to the PARASDISEC catalog web page: [http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/](http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/), and click on **Sign up** in the upper right‐hand corner. Once you sign up, you get an automated message informing you to check your email to confirm your account, 
>*"A message with a confirmation link has been sent to your email address. Please open the link to activate your account"*

Click on the link in your email to confirm. 

Congratulations, you are now a PARADISEC user! It is recommended that you browse the collections held in PARADISEC so that you can investigate the different ways collections can be organised. Below are a some examples:
* ***PhD thesis:*** [OE1](https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/72/58949afab6af0) is a collection of narratives and wordlists that the depositor used in writing their PhD thesis. This includes the segmented audio files that are linked to the exemplar utterances within the thesis.
* ***Field methods course:*** The [MEU1](https://dx.doi.org/10.26278/5e00d67b8be35) collection holds all recordings generated during a field methods course. Note how the different type of events (classroom recordings vs breakout sessions) are kept together by the nature of the item names.
* ***Separate collections for each language/dialect/variety:*** Explore two of this depositor's 27 collections, [SDM42](https://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/SDM42) and [SDM45](http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/SDM45). Each of these collections feature one language variety. There is no limit as to how many collections you can create.
* ***Many languages in one collection:*** In the [DD1](https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/72/56E8248563EE0) collection, the depositor has included recordings of over 25 languages, collected since 2010. This collection is still growing! 


## STEP 2: Contact PARADISEC to help you create a new collection

Only PARADISEC administrators can create a collection in the catalog.  When you are ready for us to create a collection, contact the PARADISEC administration at [admin@paradisec.org.au](admin@paradisec.org.au) or the [CoEDL Data Manager](mailto:julia.miller@anu.edu.au). You will need to provide us with the following information:

* Collection ID
* A brief title of your collection
* A more detailed description of your collection
* Funding body (if applicable) (e.g. ARC, ELDP, etc.)
* Grant identifier (if applicable) (e.g. CoEDL = CE140100041 or Wellsprings = FL130100111)

You can edit the collection information after it has been created, adding details such as the originating university, country, language(s), etc. You also can set the map, define access, and assign editor privileges at the collection level.

### Preliminary exploration of your files

Before you contact PARADISEC, take a look at your files and determine how you want your collection(s) presented. Do you need one collection? Or more than one? This is the time for you to reflect upon how you want your material organised in the archive.

### Information to provide to PARADISEC

Once you have decided upon which files you would like to archive, come up with a name and description for your collection. As for the Collection ID, PARADISEC administrators can help you come up with this- the collection ID should be a unique identifier (could be your initials in all caps and a digit, or the ISO language code).

*Example collection IDs: **JM1, JCM4, OE1, MEU1, etc.**
The digit is required and it distinguishes your collection from that of someone with the same initials (John Mansfield, Julia Miller, etc), but also allows for multiple collections, should you require, e.g. **JM1, JM2... JM85***.

## STEP 3: Organise materials to be sent to collection

### PARADISEC's metadata spreadsheet

### PARADISEC's file naming conventions

Now come the thrilling task of making sure your files are names appropriately

### PARADISEC's deposit form

And lastly, you need to fill out a [deposit form](http://www.paradisec.org.au/PDSCdeposit.pdf) that provides PARADISEC with your contact information, access conditions for your collection , including any restrictions. 

## STEP 4: Sending your files to PARADISEC

If you are planing to archive digital files with PARADISEC, and your institution is part of the Australian Access Federation (AAF), you can sign up for a [Cloudstor](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/) account. Once you do, you get 1TB of free storage available to you instantly. You can also send us OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive links. These options are the best means to transfer files to PARADISEC. If you do not use any of those cloud storage options, but would like to transfer your files this way, contact [PARADISEC](mailto:admin@paradisec.au.org) or the [CoEDL Data Manager](mailto:julia.miller@anu.edu.au) and we can create a Cloudstor folder for you to use for transferring files to us.

If uploading files to a cloud service is not possible due to a lack of computer access or poor internet connections, you can post a hard drive of your materials to PARADISEC at:

Room 3019, Sydney Conservatorium of Music C41 <br>
