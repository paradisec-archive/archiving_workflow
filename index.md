# Getting Started with PARADISEC

## Creating a collection with PARADISEC

Only PARADISEC administrators can create a collection in the catalog.  When you are ready for us to create a collection, contact the PARADISEC administration at [admin@paradisec.org.au](admin@paradisec.org.au). You will need to provide us with the following information:

* Collection ID (see below)
* A brief title of your collection
* A more detailed description of your collection
* Funding body (if applicable) (e.g. ARC, ELDP, etc.)
* Grant identifier (if applicable) (e.g. CoEDL = CE140100041 or Wellsprings = FL130100111)

You can edit the collection information after it has been created, adding details such as the originating university, country, language(s), etc. You also can set the map, define access, and assign editor privileges at the collection level.

### Collection ID

Once you are added as a user, we can help you start a collection.  First you need to create a name for your collection; it should be unique and include your initials (all caps and no spaces) and a digit:

Example collection IDs:
**JM1, JCM4, NT6, PK1, PK2, etc.**

The digit is required and it distinguishes you from someone with the same initials (John Mansfield, Julia Miller, etc), but also allows for multiple collections, should you require, e.g. **JM1, JM2... JM85**.
