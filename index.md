# Getting Started with PARADISEC

This page is dedicated to helping you begin the seemingly overwhelming process of getting your materials organised and eventually archived. Most of this is geared toward preparing your collection for PARADISEC, but some of the organisational concepts can be applied to depositing with other archives such as [The Endangered Language Archive (ELAR)](https://elar.soas.ac.uk/) or [The Language Archive (TLA)](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/).

## STEP 1: Sign up as a user with PARADISEC
Signing up with PARADISEC means you become a PARADISEC user. As a user you can access data in an open collections after agreeing to PARADISEC’s conditions of access, or you may send a request to access data that has restrictions on viewing by following instructions provided by the collector on their catalog page.

You also need to sign up with PARADISEC if you wish to deposit material to the archive. 

The process of signing up is simple- go to the PARASDISEC catalog web page: [http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/](http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/), and click on **Sign up** in the upper right‐hand corner. Once you sign up, you get an automated message informing you to check your email to confirm your account, _“A message with a confirmation link has been sent to your email address. Please open the link to activate your account”._ Click on the link in your email to confirm. 

You are now a PARADISEC user! It is recommended that you browse the collections held in PARADISEC so that you can investigate the different ways collections can be organised. Below are a few examples:
* ***Depositing a PhD thesis*** This collection [OE1](https://dx.doi.org/10.4225/72/58949afab6af0) is a collection of narratives and wordlists that the depositor used in writing their PhD thesis. This includes the segmented audio files that are linked to the exemplar utterances within the thesis.

## Creating a collection with PARADISEC

Only PARADISEC administrators can create a collection in the catalog.  When you are ready for us to create a collection, contact the PARADISEC administration at [admin@paradisec.org.au](admin@paradisec.org.au) or the [CoEDL Data Manager](mailto:julia.miller@anu.edu.au). You will need to provide us with the following information:

* Collection ID (see below)
* A brief title of your collection
* A more detailed description of your collection
* Funding body (if applicable) (e.g. ARC, ELDP, etc.)
* Grant identifier (if applicable) (e.g. CoEDL = CE140100041 or Wellsprings = FL130100111)

You can edit the collection information after it has been created, adding details such as the originating university, country, language(s), etc. You also can set the map, define access, and assign editor privileges at the collection level.

### Collection ID

Once you are added as a user, we can help you start a collection.  First you need to create a name for your collection; it should be unique and include your initials (all caps and no spaces) and a digit:

Example collection IDs:
**JM1, JCM4, NT6, PK1, PK2, etc.**

The digit is required and it distinguishes you from someone with the same initials (John Mansfield, Julia Miller, etc), but also allows for multiple collections, should you require, e.g. **JM1, JM2... JM85**.

### Organise your files

### Fill in metadata sheet

### Fill out deposit form

### Sending your files to PARADISEC

Sign up for a Cloudstor account if you have not already done so. Once you do so, you get 1TB of free storage available to you instantly. This is the best means to transfer files to PARADISEC.
